## Tips for Getting Started

- Use the yandeu.five-server Live Server extension for VS Code to see your changes in real-time.
- Create an index.html, style.css and app.js file and link them together.
- I use the Cascadia Code font in my editor, but you can use any font you like.
- Use the Figma file to see how the project should look.
